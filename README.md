This project is a Python-based keylogger simulation developed with the Pygame library, designed specifically for educational and cybersecurity awareness purposes. Unlike malicious keyloggers, this implementation operates in a fully transparent and controlled environment, allowing users to visualize and understand the process of keystroke logging without any security risks. The application provides an interactive virtual keyboard interface that highlights keys as they are pressed, displays real-time input on screen, and saves each session to timestamped log files for review. To ensure user control and ethical use, it includes functional options such as Start Logging, Stop Logging, and Clear Logs, giving participants complete visibility over the logging process. This simulation serves as a valuable resource for classroom demonstrations, academic projects, and self-learning in cybersecurity, offering hands-on exposure to the concept of keylogging while emphasizing the importance of responsible practices. Beyond its practical applications, it also illustrates the integration of Python programming with graphical interface design, making it an excellent example for students and enthusiasts exploring both coding and cybersecurity.
